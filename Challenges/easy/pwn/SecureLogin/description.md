## Secure Login (Easy - Pwn)



### Description

I found this portal on internet...

It seems that it will give you a flag only if you are an Admin.

How can you bypass authentication?

### Compile

```
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

### Execute
```
chmod +x dist/SecureLogin
cd dist
./SecureLogin
```
