## Find the link (Easy - Reversing)

### Description

Oh my God. This is driving me crazy.

I think that there's a way to discover the algorithm behind the link check... but HOW?

### Compile

```
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

### Execute
```
chmod +x dist/FindTheLink
cd dist
./FindTheLink
```

#### Hint

How does the program check the validity of the input?
Focus on ```int check_password(char* password)```
Hint is: ??????/????????????in?ha??ati
